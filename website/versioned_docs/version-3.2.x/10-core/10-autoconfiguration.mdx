# Autoconfiguration

This section shows how to set up autoconfiguration using two methods.

## Using Annotation

To set up autoconfiguration, just use the [`@EnableExchangeClients`](https://github.com/DanielLiu1123/httpexchange-spring-boot-starter/blob/main/httpexchange-spring-boot-autoconfigure/src/main/java/io/github/danielliu1123/httpexchange/EnableExchangeClients.java)
annotation. This works like `@EnableFeignClients` and tells the framework where to find `HttpExchange` clients, then registering them as beans.

By default, it looks for clients in the same package as the annotated class.

- Specifying `basePackages`:

    ```java
    @EnableExchangeClients(basePackages = "com.example")
    ```

    :::info
    If you specify packages with `basePackages`, it will only look in those packages, not the one with the annotated class.
    :::

- Specifying `clients`:

    ```java
    @EnableExchangeClients(clients = {PostApi.class, UserApi.class})
    ```

    :::info
    This is quicker than `basePackages` because it doesn't have to scan the classpath.
    :::

- Combining `basePackages` with `clients`:

    ```java
    @EnableExchangeClients(basePackages = "com.example", clients = {PostApi.class, UserApi.class})
    ```

## Using Configuration

If you don't want to use annotations, you can set up using configuration.

```yaml title="application.yml"
http-exchange:
   base-packages: com.example
   clients:
     - com.foo.PostApi
     - com.bar.UserApi
```

:::info
If you use both the annotation and config file, the settings from the annotation are used first.
