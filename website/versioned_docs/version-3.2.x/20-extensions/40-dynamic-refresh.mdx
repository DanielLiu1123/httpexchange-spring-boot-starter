# Dynamic Refresh

Support to dynamically refresh the configuration of clients, you can put the configuration in the configuration
center ([Consul](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul), [Apollo](https://github.com/apolloconfig/apollo), [Nacos](https://github.com/alibaba/nacos),
etc.), and change the configuration (e.g. `base-url`, `timeout`, `headers`), the client will be refreshed automatically
without restarting the application.

Use the following configuration to enable this feature:

```yaml title="application.yml"
http-exchange:
   refresh:
      enabled: true # default is false
```

:::tip
This feature needs `spring-cloud-context` in the classpath and a `RefreshEvent` was published.
