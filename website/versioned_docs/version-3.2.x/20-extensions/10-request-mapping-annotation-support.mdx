# `@RequestMapping` Support

Support to use spring web annotations to generate HTTP clients, e.g., `@RequestMapping`, `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping` etc.

Supports all features of `@HttpExchange`.

```java
@RequestMapping("/typicode/demo")
public interface PostApi {
    @GetMapping("/posts/{id}")
    Post getPost(@PathVariable("id") int id);
}
```

:::info
Since 3.2.0, `@RequestMapping` support is disabled by default, you can set `http-exchange.request-mapping-support-enabled=true` to enable it.

Consider using `@HttpExchange` instead of `@RequestMapping` if possible.
