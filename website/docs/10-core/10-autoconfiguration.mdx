# Autoconfiguration

To enable autoconfiguration for clients, there are two options.

## Using Annotation

To enable autoconfiguration for clients, simply add the `@EnableExchangeClients` annotation.
This annotation functions similarly to `@EnableFeignClients`, telling the framework where to look for HttpExchange clients and then registering them as beans.

It automatically scans the clients within the package of the annotated class by default.

- Using `basePackages`

    ```java
    @EnableExchangeClients(basePackages = "com.example")
    ```

    :::info
    If specific packages are specified, only those packages will be scanned, excluding the package of the annotated class.
    :::

- Using `clients`

    ```java
    @EnableExchangeClients(clients = {PostApi.class, UserApi.class})
    ```

    :::info
    It's faster than using `basePackages` because it doesn't require scanning the classpath.
    :::

- Using both `basePackages` and `clients`

    ```java
    @EnableExchangeClients(basePackages = "com.example", clients = {PostApi.class, UserApi.class})
    ```

## Using Configuration

If you prefer not to introduce external classes, you can achieve the same functionality through configuration:

```yaml title="application.yml"
http-exchange:
   base-packages: com.example
   clients:
     - com.foo.PostApi
     - com.bar.UserApi
```

:::info
When both configuration and annotations are used, the value from the annotation takes precedence.
