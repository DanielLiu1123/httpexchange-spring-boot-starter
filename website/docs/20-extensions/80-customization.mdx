# Customization

This library is designed to be highly customizable. You can customize the behavior of the library by providing your own implementations.

## Custom [HttpServiceArgumentResolver](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current//javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/service/invoker/class-use/HttpServiceArgumentResolver.html)

```java
@Bean
HttpServiceArgumentResolver yourHttpServiceArgumentResolver() {
  return new YourHttpServiceArgumentResolver();
}
```

Auto-detect all the `HttpServiceArgumentResolver` beans, then apply them to build the `HttpServiceProxyFactory`.

## Change Client Type

There are many adapters for HttpExchange client: `RestClientAdapter`, `WebClientAdapter` and `RestTemplateAdapter`.

```yaml title="application.yml"
http-exchange:
  client-type: REST_CLIENT
```

The framework will choose the appropriate adapter according to the http client interface.
If any method in the interface returns a reactive type (Mono/Flux), then `WebClient` will be used, otherwise `RestClient` will be used.
**In most cases, there's no need to explicitly specify the client type.**

:::warning
The `connectTimeout` settings are not supported by `WEB_CLIENT`.

## Change Http Client Implementation

For `RestClient` and `RestTemplate`, there are many built-in implementations of [`ClientHttpRequestFactory`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/http/client/ClientHttpRequestFactory.html),
use `JdkClientHttpRequestFactory` by default.

```java
// Change ClientHttpRequestFactory for RestClient
@Bean
RestClientCustomizer restClientCustomizer() {
    return builder -> builder.requestFactory(new ReactorNettyClientRequestFactory());
}

// Change ClientHttpRequestFactory for RestTemplate
@Bean
RestTemplateCustomizer restTemplateCustomizer() {
    return restTemplate -> restTemplate.setRequestFactory(new ReactorNettyClientRequestFactory());
}

// Change ClientHttpConnector for WebClient
@Bean
WebClientCustomizer webClientCustomizer() {
    return builder -> builder.clientConnector(new ReactorClientHttpConnector());
}
```

:::note
Dynamic `read-timeout` for single request is only supported by `EnhancedJdkClientHttpRequestFactory`.
Spring does not provide an extension point to support this feature,
see [issue](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/31926).
